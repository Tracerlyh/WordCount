The British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is offering toscale back Britain¡¯s nuclear deterrence if an international agreement is reached tocut the world¡¯s nuclear arsenals. Mr. Brown is expected to tell a special session of the United Nations SecurityCouncil on Thursday that he¡¯ll be willingto give up one of four royal navy submarines that carry Trident nuclearmissiles. Officials are insisting that cost isn¡¯t a factor here. Here¡¯s ourdefence correspondent Nick Childs. Gordon Brown is saying he¡¯ll be ready tothrow part of the trident force into the port in the context of a much bigger global disarmamentdeal. He said so in general terms before. This offer though is more concrete. There is a growingsense that to avoid what some fear could be a sudden cascade of new nuclear states, theestablished nuclear powers need to do more in terms of disarmament to keep the proliferation regimeintact. The Prime Minister will hope his move will be seen as an important gesture. But the key tothe process will be the actions of the big players, the United Statesand Russia.
